# Fillit

A project to discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming : searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities. In this particular project, we are charged of creating an algorithm which fits some Tetrominos (4-blocks geometric figures popularised by the game Tetris) together into the smallest possible square.

## How to use

- Compile : `make`
- Remove object files : `make clean`
- Remove object files and program : `make fclean`
- Start fresh and re-compile : `make re`

## Executing

Execute the program with the file of your choice like this : `./fillit yourfile`
You can also use our test files located in the "TestFiles" directory.
